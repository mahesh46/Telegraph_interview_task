CODING EXERCISE iOS

Required tasks:
- app should connect to the sample API to asynchronously get the data. Try to use
standard libraries and justify in the README file the choice of a 3rd party library
highlight reasons,pros and cons of the decision.
- app should work on phone in portrait.
- The app must be written in Swift
Additional tasks:
- App UI should be fully responsive to be able to work on portrait and landscape and
on phones and tablets.
- Implement unit Testing.

Part 2 involves a 1/2 hour pair programming exercise with the iOS tech lead at the Telegraph. An XCode playground file will be provided with a short programming exercise to complete on the call.
